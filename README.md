# **About**
**Every 60 seconds you will get a complete random effect**
  - Such as: Spawn a mob, get an item, or something crazier, like an anvil apocalypse or start a raid!
  - There are currently a total of **140 effects!**
    - Inside the .zip there's a text file with a list of all effects, if you're curious
  - Most effects last 3 minutes, but in some cases they last for 1 minute, 30 seconds or less
    - There's also a mode with less cooldown on effects, so you get one every 30 seconds, but all the effects will last half of their usual time
    
# **The datapack also includes a mode for voting!**
  - On spectator voting mode, spectator (the gamemode) players can vote for the effects the runner will be getting
  - Every 30 seconds, spectators will get a poll with 3 effects to vote for, then another 30 seconds after, the effect will be applied (one effect per minute)
    - If there is a tie, a random effect from the poll will be selected
  - Also includes a mode with more cooldown on effects, so you get one every 1:30 minutes, but they last 50% more of their usual time
  - For now, it only works with players inside the world on spectator mode, since I don't have modding knowledge to do something like a Twitch chat voting thingy (pls help if you know)

# **Want to report a bug, suggest an effect or a change?**
Go to issues and create a new one. In the beginning of the title put something like (Effect) or (Bug) to label it, and then type the thing you want

# **Enjoy the chaos!**
I'm not that good at making datapacks, and this is the first time I post a big one online, but I just wanted to make this since I had so much fun watching and playing runs with the GTA Chaos Mod, so thanks to Lordmau5, pongo1231, Bart de Bever, and Parik27 for making it!

# **Twitch voting mode?**
As I said above, I don't have any modding knowledge, so I can't figure out a way to make this happen. I thought I could get someone who knows to help me do it, but I don't know anyone. So, if you like this datapack and have/know someone who knows how to make mods for the game and implement this, send me a DM on discord! Shaaron#6215 :)
