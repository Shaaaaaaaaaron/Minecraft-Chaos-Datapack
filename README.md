# **Minecraft Chaos Datapack**

A challenge datapack for Minecraft, inspired by the GTA Chaos Mod.

# **About**
**-Every 60 seconds you will get a complete random effect**
  -Such as: Spawn a mob, get an item, or something crazier, like an anvil apocalypse or start a raid!
    -Inside the .zip there's a text file with a list of all effects, if you're curious
  -Most effects last 3 minutes, but in some cases they last for 1 minute, 30 seconds or less
    -There's also a mode with less cooldown on effects, so you get one every 30 seconds, but all the effects will last half of their usual time
    
**-The datapack also includes a mode for voting!**
  -On spectator voting mode, spectator (the gamemode) players can vote for the effects the runner will be getting
  -Every 30 seconds, spectators will get a poll with 3 effects to vote for, then another 30 seconds after, the effect will be applied (one effect per minute)
    -If there is a tie, a random effect from the poll will be selected
  -Also includes a mode with more cooldown on effects, so you get one every 1:30 minutes, but they last 50% more of their usual time
  -For now, it only works with players inside the world on spectator mode, since I don't have modding knowledge to do something like a Twitch chat voting thingy
  
  # **How to use**
  -When you first join the world, you will get a message on your chat with some info. Click the text that it indicates to start, or type **/trigger chaos.settings**
  -You will get this on your chat, click the squares on the left to select a mode

    -You can also join a team at any point by using **/trigger chaos.runner** or **/trigger chaos.spectator**
